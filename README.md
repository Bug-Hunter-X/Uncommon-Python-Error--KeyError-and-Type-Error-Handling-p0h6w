This repository showcases an example of uncommon Python errors and how to handle them effectively. The 'bug.py' file demonstrates potential KeyError exceptions due to accessing non-existent keys in dictionaries, which can lead to unexpected crashes. Additionally, it demonstrates the handling of TypeErrors. The corresponding solution, 'bugSolution.py' provides best practices for exception handling, preventing the program from crashing and ensuring graceful failure.
